# casuya-platform

Student, admin, and teacher web platform for Casuya (`casuya.co.tz`) focused on lesson delivery, quizzes, games, progress tracking, and analytics for schools operating on unreliable and low-bandwidth internet connections.

---

## Vision

Casuya is designed for Tanzanian secondary education and prioritizes:

* Low-end Android devices
* 2G and 3G networks
* Offline-first experiences
* High scalability
* Modular and replaceable components
* Fast lesson delivery
* Low operational costs

Speed is a product feature, not merely an optimization.

Routers must never:

* Execute business logic
* Query external services directly
* Call integrations directly
* Manipulate storage directly

Flow:

# Database

Contains:

* Migrations
* Seed data
* Schema notes
* Backups

Primary entities:

* Users
* Roles
* Students
* Teachers
* Subjects
* Topics
* Subtopics
* Lessons
* Lesson Versions

---

# Storage

Stores large files outside the database.

```text
storage/
├── lesson-packages/
├── images/
├── videos/
├── audio/
├── exports/
└── backups/
```

Database rows should store metadata and package references only.

Large HTML lessons should never be stored directly in database rows.

# Integrations

```text
integrations/
├── casuya_core
├── casuya_runtime
├── casuya_bridge
├── supabase
├── cloudflare
├── azampay
└── africastalking
```

Integrations may only be called from:

```text
backend/services/*
```

Never from routers.

---

# Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Run commands from the project root:

```bash
cd casuya-platform
```

Health endpoint:

```text
http://localhost:8000/health
```

# Current Status

Implemented:

* Project structure
* Configuration layer
* SQLAlchemy models
* Database relationships
* Main application wiring
* Router registration
* Development scaffolding

Stubbed:

* API routes
* Services
* Middleware
* External integrations

Recommended implementation order:

1. Authentication
2. Subjects
3. Topics
4. Subtopics
5. Lessons
6. casuya-core packaging flow
7. Progress tracking
8. Analytics
9. Notifications
10. Payments

# Developer Principles

1. Performance first.
2. Offline first.
3. Package lessons instead of storing large HTML blobs.
4. Keep business logic inside services.
5. Keep integrations isolated.
6. Prefer caching over repeated queries.
7. Everything should be modular and replaceable.
8. Never break existing lesson packages.
9. Optimize for low-end Android devices first.
10. Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible.
11. Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
12. Design for 100,000+ concurrent students.

# Architectural Contract

This section is frozen. Future changes should implement functionality
while preserving these boundaries unless there is a compelling reason to
revise the architecture itself.

## `backend/api`

Responsibilities:

* HTTP endpoints
* Request validation
* Response serialization
* Authentication guards

Must not:

* Call integrations directly
* Implement business logic
* Access storage directly

## `backend/services`

Responsibilities:

* Business rules
* Transactions
* Orchestration
* Integration coordination

May call:

* Models
* Tasks
* Integrations
* Storage

## `backend/models`

Responsibilities:

* SQLAlchemy entities
* Relationships
* Constraints
* Query helpers

Must not:

* Call integrations
* Contain application workflows

## `backend/tasks`

Responsibilities:

* Background jobs

## Example Flow — Student Opens Lesson

```text
Student
    ↓
GET /lessons/{id}
    ↓
api/lessons.py
    ↓
lesson_service.py
    ↓
Lesson Model
    ↓
